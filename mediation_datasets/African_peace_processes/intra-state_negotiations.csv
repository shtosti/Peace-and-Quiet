They had agreed that Nkunda’s troops would be integrated into the national army with the system of Brassage, meaning that troops loyal to him would be mixed with troops loyal to the central government. However, rather than diluting Nkunda’s influence, this deal extended his influence beyond his original sphere of influence. It was agreed that if the FDLR would be defeated, the Banyamulenge refugees would be able to return to the DRC and Nkunda would go into exile.

Although the UN representatives participated in the conference, the two chief mediators were Abbé Appollinaire Malu Malu and Vital Kamerhe. These two Congolese politicians had been mandated to mediate by the Government. Prior to the actual conference, the chief mediators went on an extensive awareness-raising tour through North and South Kivu. On the basis of different consultations and meetings during this tour, a document specifying 15 objectives of the conference was produced. While the organizers of the conference expected 600 participants, around 1500 people showed up at Goma at the start of the conference on 6 January 2008. The FDLR or the Rwandan government did not participate in the talks. The role of the UN representatives was twofold. First, they served as observers in order to ensure the neutrality of the talks. Second, in addition to participating in the plenary meetings, the UN representatives held secret bilateral meetings with Government of the DRC and the CNDP leadership. The conference led to the conclusion of an immediate ceasefire under the Act d’Engagement, Nord Kivu on 23 January 2008, as well a promise by the CNDP to withdraw all of its fighters from the North Kivu province, and impunity for Nkunda’s forces. The agreement also enlisted the DRC government to remove FDLR forces from North Kivu, yet the CNDP remained dissatisfied with the results and they declared war on the FDLR. Consequently, the ceasefire did not hold and intense fighting took place throughout the rest of the year. Civilians blamed the UN, claiming that MONUC had done nothing to prevent the CNDP from advancing. The UN then prevented CNDP fighters from advancing on Goma. On 28 October 2008, fighting took place between CNDP and government-MONUC joined troops. The CNDP declared a unilateral ceasefire on 29 October. Yet, they broke it and advanced further.

309,663,663-1,Sudan,SPLM/A,"Negotiations between the Sudanese government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) took place for the first time on 31 July 1986, when John Garang and Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi met for talks in which the two key demands of the SLPM/A were discussed: the suspension of the Sharia and the termination of military pacts with Libya and Egypt. However, on 16 August 1986, the peace talks were suspended due to the SPLM/A bombing a civil airplane, which resulted in the death of 60 passengers. Egypt – in spite of its military support to the Government of Sudan – managed to facilitate contacts between the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and SPLM/A in the mid-1988. The DUP was one of the three parties in Khartoum’s ruling coalition. Ethiopia subsequently offered to host talks in Addis Ababa between the DUP and the SPLM/A. This led to the signing of what has been referred to as the DUP-SPLM/A Sudan Peace Agreement on 16 November 1988 by DUP leader Mohamed Osman al-Mirghani and SPLM/A leader John Garang de Mabior. However, the agreement soon collapsed as a result of an internal power struggle within the Government of Sudan. The opposition in the coalition government, the National Islamic Front (NIF), did not accept the peace agreement, as it wished to maintain Islamic law and refused to abrogate military pacts with Egypt and Libya. The NIF denounced the talks as a conspiracy to block Islamic law. Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi voted down a DUP amendment to recognise the terms of the DUP-SPLM/A Sudan Peace Agreement. Consequently, the DUP resigned from government on 27 December 1988. In March 1989, a new Government assumed power, which proposed a peace plan that was based on the peace deal that was reached between SPLM/A and DUP in November 1988, calling for a freeze on Islamic laws.

Similarly, Zaire and Egypt mediated in 1990, but could not bring the conflict parties to the negotiation table. The Government of Sudan took the initiative in March 1990 to request the US to mediate. The US subsequently initiated a mediation effort. In order to move the conflict parties towards a peace settlement, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Herman Cohen began to shuttle between the conflict parties in March 1990. Cohen formulated a proposal that stipulated the conclusion of a ceasefire, withdrawal of troops, followed by a constitutional conference that would decide on a federal system. With regard to the withdrawal of troops, Cohen proposed the complete evacuation of the national army to positions north of the 11th parallel, while the SPLM/A had to guarantee that it would not take control of southern Sudan militarily if the government forces would withdraw. With neither conflict party agreeing to this proposal, Cohen subsequently formulated a new proposal, which stipulated that half of the government forces would be pulled out from southern Sudan, while the SPLM/A would in exchange withdraw all its troops 15 kilometres from the besieged towns. Moreover, the withdrawal of troops would be internationally monitored. Cohen also proposed to hold a constitutional conference . Cohen personally presented the adapted proposal to President al-Bashir in Khartoum on 9 March 1990. While al-Bashir promised Cohen to study the proposal carefully, he soon conveyed that he rejected the possibility of a constitutional conference, preferring bilateral talks with John Garrang. The Government of Sudan also refused to withdraw from some garrison towns in areas controlled by the rebels including some oil fields.  This terminated his round of shuttle talks in March 1990. In May, Cohen again tried to imitate a peace conference, but the government side officially rejected this option on 4 June 1990.",Sudan,1990,3,1990,3,US,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,,,,4335,1,0,0

Salim shuttled between the conflict parties and his efforts led to the conflict parties accepting mediation by the Organization of African Unity and Nigeria.

In spite of separate consultations, Nigeria and the Organization of African Unity did not mediate any direct peace talks between the conflict parties in 1991.

The coup led to the formation of an umbrella opposition group called the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). In 1990, the SPLM/A joined the NDA, which at the time was a non-militant opposition group. The NDA aimed to remove the regime and set up a democratic system in Sudan. The NDA further envisioned that as part of this new democratic system the people in the South would have the right to a referendum on self-determination. The NDA was fairly loosely organised, composed of a variety of different entities such as civil society organisations, as well as rebel groups. Groups taking part in the alliance have on several occasions acted on their own, both when it comes to negotiations with and fighting against the government. Until 1996, the NDA was a solely political platform, but in September 1996, the NDA decided to set up a joint military force. After this point the NDA was both an umbrella organisation and an organisation with its own military and commanders fighting under the NDA banner. The Sudan peace process led by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) solely included the government and the SPLM/A. Hence, the NDA as an alliance was excluded from all negotiations mediated by IGAD.  In July 1999, Libyan leader of state Muammar al-Gaddafi proposed a conference on national dialogue at a NDA meeting in Tripoli. Both the NDA leadership and the Sudanese government accepted to engage in negotiations mediated by Libya and Egypt. A five-point peace plan was subsequently presented by Libya and Egypt, which included the whole NDA in the process. This plan was welcomed by the NDA as the best comprehensive political solution to the civil war. The Government of Sudan also approved of the five-point plan. The Libyan-Egyptian peace initiative faced great obstacles due to Egypt’s opposition to self-determination for the south, which was one of the cornerstones of the IGAD peace process. Nevertheless, SPLM/A leader John Garang expressed his support for the Libyan-Egyptian initiative in principle, but called for a coordination with the IGAD process. In spite of the acceptance of the peace plan, no direct negotiations between the NDA and the Government of Sudan took place as part this initiative. No negotiations or mediation took place in 1999. Egypt mediated between the adversaries through separate meetings with representatives from the Government of Sudan and the leaders of the NDA.

From the start of the seventh round of talks, the pressure on the conflict parties to sign a peace agreement steadily increased. The Western governments funding the peace process warned the parties that funding for the peace process could dry up in the absence of progress during the talks. The meetings of the seventh round of negotiations were held at different locations, but finished again in Abuja. The negotiations took place within three categories: power sharing, wealth sharing, and security arrangements. On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006.

US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and British Secretary of State for International Development Hilary Benn took over the mediation process in this final stage of the seventh round of the Abuja peace talks. Only two 48-hr extensions to the talks’ deadline were subsequently allowed. The US mediation team promised the rebel leaders that if they signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), the US would guarantee its implementation. To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US’s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N’djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and an assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee. In spite of the pressure put on the conflict parties to sign the peace agreement, the JEM and the SLM/A led by Abdul Wahid refused to sign the agreement, leaving the SLM/A led by Minni Minnawi as the only rebel party that signed the DPA on 5 May 2006. From the signing of the DPA on 5 May 2006 onwards, AU mediators Alex de Waal and Sam Ibok met with SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid several times a day to get clarity on his objections to the DPA. They encouraged him to write to Salim Ahmed Salim a letter in which he could specify on what was needed in order for him to sign the DPA. In his letter send to Salim on 10 May, Abdul Wahid proposed to conclude a ‘supplementary agreement’ to the DPA, demanding greater representation at the legislature and executive bodies of Darfur, as well as a larger compensation fund for Darfur. However, Salim knew that the chief government negotiator, Majzoub El Khalifa, would reject this option, instead insisting that Abdul Wahid had to sign the DPA first, after which some of the remaining issues could be negotiated. Consequently, on 13 May 2006, Salim replied to Wahid that the AU could not re-open negotiations on the DPA, but was willing to support the conflict parties in implementing the agreement. Sam Ibok subsequently tried to persuade Wahid that the AU’s insistence on implementation rather than concluding a supplementary agreement would still allow Wahid to get what he wanted. Ibok’s effort to persuade Wahid did not work. Wahid kept insisting on a supplementary agreement. The AU Peace and Security Council decided on 16 May 2006 that the non-signatory groups would have another two weeks to sign the DPA.",Nigeria,2006,5,2006,5,AU; US; UK,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Darfur Peace Agreement ,2006,5,5,0,0,0,1

As a result, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim resigned in July 2008, after which Djibril Bassolé assumed the role of chief mediator, the former foreign-minister of Burkina Faso. In addition to the joint UN/AU initiative, Qatar conducted some effort to initiate negotiations. However, no negotiations took place in 2008 as the warring parties did not meet each other. JEM resisted negotiations with other rebel groups present and said that they should be the only one representing the Darfur side in the negotiations. The reason they stated for this was that the government could play the rebels against each other if they were represented by several groups. Bassolé went along with this demand by JEM, because he also believed that if the JEM would sign a deal, then the other rebel parties would follow.  In January 2009, after it had been agreed that JEM would be the sole representative of the Darfurian rebels, Djibril Bassolé succeeded in initiating negotiations between the Government of Sudan and the JEM.

The Western governments funding the peace process warned the parties that funding for the peace process could dry up in the absence of progress during the talks. The meetings of the seventh round of negotiations were held at different locations, but finished again in Abuja. The negotiations took place within three categories: power sharing, wealth sharing, and security arrangements. On the basis of the bilateral consultations and plenary sessions on these three categories which had been ongoing for more than five months, the AU mediation team submitted to the parties a draft peace agreement for the parties to sign in late April 2006.

US Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick and British Secretary of State for International Development Hilary Benn took over the mediation process in this final stage of the seventh round of the Abuja peace talks. Only two 48-hr extensions to the talks’ deadline were subsequently allowed. The US mediation team promised the rebel leaders that if they signed the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), the US would guarantee its implementation. To back-up this promise, Zoellick carried personal letters with him from President George W. Bush assuring the rebel leaders of the US’s commitment to the DPA. In addition, the UN Security Council had imposed an arms embargo on all non-governmental entities operating in Darfur in July 2004. This sanctions regime was strengthened with the adoption of resolution 1591 in March 2005, which expanded the scope of arms embargo to also include all the parties to the N’djamena Ceasefire Agreement and any other belligerents, as well as imposed a travel ban and an assets freeze on individuals designated by the UN Sanctions Committee. In spite of the pressure put on the conflict parties to sign the peace agreement, the JEM and the SLM/A led by Abdul Wahid refused to sign the agreement, leaving the SLM/A led by Minni Minnawi as the only rebel party that signed the DPA on 5 May 2006. From the signing of the DPA on 5 May 2006 onwards, AU mediators Alex de Waal and Sam Ibok met with SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid several times a day to get clarity on his objections to the DPA. They encouraged him to write to Salim Ahmed Salim a letter in which he could specify on what was needed in order for him to sign the DPA. In his letter send to Salim on 10 May, Abdul Wahid proposed to conclude a ‘supplementary agreement’ to the DPA, demanding greater representation at the legislature and executive bodies of Darfur, as well as a larger compensation fund for Darfur. However, Salim knew that the chief government negotiator, Majzoub El Khalifa, would reject this option, instead insisting that Abdul Wahid had to sign the DPA first, after which some of the remaining issues could be negotiated. Consequently, on 13 May 2006, Salim replied to Wahid that the AU could not re-open negotiations on the DPA, but was willing to support the conflict parties in implementing the agreement. Sam Ibok subsequently tried to persuade Wahid that the AU’s insistence on implementation rather than concluding a supplementary agreement would still allow Wahid to get what he wanted. Ibok’s effort to persuade Wahid did not work. Wahid kept insisting on a supplementary agreement. The AU Peace and Security Council decided on 16 May 2006 that the non-signatory groups would have another two weeks to sign the DPA.",Nigeria,2006,5,2006,5,AU; US; UK,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Darfur Peace Agreement ,2006,5,5,58,1,0,0

Instead, he flew to Asmara, Eritrea, at the invitation of JEM leader Khalil Ibrahim to discuss the founding of a rebel alliance. In February 2007, a joint UN/AU mediation effort was initiated, headed by Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim, who respectively represented the UN and the AU. The SLM/A faction led by Minni Minnawi lost power and the movement was now led by Abdul Wahid. The SLM/A refused to attend the UN/AU organised negotiations in Sirtre, Libya. Hence, they were not involved in any negotiations with the Government of Sudan in 2007, although the SLM/A leadership did consult with the UN/AU negotiation team. In the beginning of 2008, the joint UN/AU mediation effort continued. Yet, no substantial progress was made. As a result, Jan Eliasson and Salim Ahmed Salim resigned in July 2008, after which Djibril Bassolé assumed the role of chief mediator, the former foreign-minister of Burkina Faso. In addition to the joint UN/AU initiative, Qatar conducted some effort to initiate negotiations. However, no real negotiations took place in 2008 as the warring parties did not meet each other. Abdul Wahid, the leader of SLM/A, demanded that security had to be provided for the civilians in Darfur before he would enter negotiations. Djibril Bassolé continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort in 2009. SLM/A leader Abdul Wahid refused to leave his exile in Paris. Consequently, no negotiations were held between the SPLM/A and the Government of Sudan in 2009.In 2010, Djibril Bassolé continued his efforts as the chief mediator of the joint UN/AU mediation effort.

Zoellick also threatened Minni Minawi with possible UN sanctions or an International Criminal Court indictment if he did not sign the agreement. In addition, Zoellick threatened that an attack on Minawi’s forces in South Darfur by Sudanese troops would be executed if he failed to sign the DPA. Despite these threats, Minawi still had reservations when the final stretch of the Abuja talks started on 4 May, which were hosted by Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo at his state house in Abuja. During a break of the plenary peace talks on 4 May, Zoellick allegedly told Minawi privately, “Have no doubt where I stand.

314,688,688-1,Uganda,LRA,"In early 1987, Joseph Kony decided to take up arms against the Government of Uganda, declaring that he had been instructed by the Holy Spirit to fight and overthrow the new Government. Kony subsequently left his home together with a small number of followers. Soon thereafter, Kony’s group met a number of Acholi soldiers who turned out to be the rebel group UPDA’s Black Battalion under the leadership of Major Benjamin Apia. Kony persuaded the Black Battalion to recognise his spiritual guidance and became their leader. By late 1987, Kony had assembled a large following, which he named the United Holy Salvation Army (UHSA). Abel Okumu, an Angelican priest from Uganda, attempted to mediate between the Government of Uganda and Joseph Kony’s UHSA in June 1987. However, a breakdown in communications led to an attack by government forces on Kony before direct talks could be initiated. Kony blamed Okumu and killed him shortly afterwards. In 1988, Severino Lukoya, the leader of the Lord’s Army and the father of the self-proclaimed spirit medium Alice Lakwena, was captured by government forces. This provided Kony, who allegedly was Alice Lakwena’s second cousin, the opportunity to assume leadership over the remaining fighters of the Lord’s Army. He subsequently named his group of fighters the Uganda Christian Democratic Army (UCDA).  In late 1991, Kony changed the name of his group of followers to the Lord’s Resistance Army (LRA). The Ugandan Minister for the North, Betty Bigombe, initiated contacts with the LRA in mid-1993. This was done through Kony’s close friend Yusuf Okwonga Adek, a northerner residing in Gulu, who delivered a letter from Bigombe to Kony. Adek continued his work as an intermediary between June and November 1993, shuttling between the conflict parties and laying the groundwork for future talks. This led to the first face-to-face peace meeting ever between Government representatives and the rebels on 25 November 1993. The talks were held at Pagik in the Gulu district. The Government delegation was led by Bigombe and included Acholi elders, the Director of Military Intelligence Lieutenant Colonel Fred Toolit, and Colonel Samuel Wasswa. Joseph Kony did not attend the meeting, but sent a tape-recorded message. The parties agreed that they would stop fighting. The LRA promised they would gather in a gazetted area where they would be able to move freely. During the talks, the LRA negotiators demanded an amnesty for all their fighters. A LRA Commander, Cirilo Jurukadri Odego, emphasised that in order for talks to succeed “old wounds should not be reopened.” Bigombe responded by assuring the LRA delegation that the LRA fighters would all be covered by the already existing general amnesty. However, in the weeks after the meeting at Pagik, Bigombe came under increasing pressure. For instance, Brigadier Mugume and Lieutenant Colonel Toolit accused Bigombe of having “caved in too much” to LRA demands.

The team initially conducted informal talks with rebel officers, attempting to find out what the rebel’s demands were. As this became increasingly clear, Bigombe arranged a meeting between LRA officers and Acholi elders, which was one of the rebel’s pre-conditions for holding formal peace talks.

Determined to get the LRA out of South Sudan, Machar gave the LRA three options: an ultimatum to either leave Sudanese territory peacefully, accept mediation with the Government of Uganda, or face military action. The threat of military action against the LRA remained implicit throughout the Juba peace talks. After a round of pre-negotiations in May 2006, the conflict parties officially agreed to mediation by Riek Machar and it was decided that the negotiations would start in Juba on 14 July 2006.",,2006,5,2006,5,Sudan; Pax Christi; Netherlands; Switzerland; UN,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,,,,221,1,0,0

This announcement received widespread attention, since Kony and four of his deputies had been indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. At Juba, Machar was supported both by a mediation team within his vice-Presidential office and by a mediation group that included delegates of Pax Christi, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Switzerland, provided a professional negotiator that assisted Machar during the talks, while Pax Christi provided the LRA delegates with training in negotiating. The Community of Sant’Egidio, who had been invited by the LRA, also attended the negotiations. UN representatives from the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Department of Political Affairs were also involved in the process to advice on issues related to the protection of internally displaced persons political aspects of the process respectively. Neither Kony nor his top commanders attended the talks at Juba.  Instead, the LRA delegation consisted of 14 negotiators, who had been appointed by Kony. Almost all of these 14 negotiators were Acholis from the Diaspora. The negotiation teams at Juba soon managed to agree on the issues that needed to be addressed in order to resolve the armed conflict: the cessation of hostilities; comprehensive solutions addressing the underlying issues of the conflict; reconciliation and accountability; the conclusion of a formal ceasefire; and disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of the fighters. Yet, the parties were unable to agree in which order these issues needed to be addressed and talks were adjourned on 24 July.

The focus in the negotiations subsequently shifted to the provisions for a final ceasefire, followed by talks on disarmament, demobilization and reintegration.

314,688,688-37,Uganda,LRA," On 10 April, all actors that had been involved in the Juba talks assembled at Ri-Kwangba to witness the signing of the final agreement. However, Kony did not show up, stating he wanted clarification on the issues of the Mato Oput (traditional judicial system) and the Special Division of the High Court. Kony stated he no longer trusted the mediators, claiming that they were in favour of the Government of Uganda. Kony also fired Matsanga, replacing him with James Obita. The legitimacy of LRA’s negotiation team was thus seriously hampered. This problem became even become worse when Matsanga reappeared in June 2008 and claimed to have been reinstated by Kony as the chief negotiator, which has remained unclear whether this was the case. UN Secretary-General’s special envoy Joaquim Chissano worked to get the negotiations process back on track after Kony had failed to turn up for the signing ceremony on 10 April 2008. To this purpose, Chissano held a series of separate meetings with President Museveni and Kony between April and July 2008. While the LRA continued to request further mediated negotiations, Uganda’s president Museveni stated in July 2008 that his government would not hold further negotiations with Kony. Instead, the Government of Uganda would wait for Kony to sign the Final Peace Agreement. On 11 September, Machar declared the peace process over. Another signing ceremony was prepared in November, but Kony again failed to show up. The LRA called for a ceasefire in January, March, and June 2009. However, the LRA was only willing to resume peace talks provided that another mediator would lead the process and that talks would be held at another venue. In October 2009, Matsanga stated that talks should be held on “neutral ground” such as in Kenya or Tanzania. Matsanga also claimed that Kony would prefer Nigerian ex-president Olusegun Obasanjo to act as the chief mediator. Machar conducted yet a final attempt at restarting negotiations at Juba by the end of September 2009. Prior to Machar’s attempt, Chissano had made several attempts to find a credible negotiator of the LRA, but concluded that this was impossible and ended his role as Special Envoy to the Secretary-General on 29 May 2009. The Government of Uganda rejected calls for peace talks, regardless of the venue and chief mediator, stating that an agreement had already been reached and that the only thing missing was Kony’s signature on the final accord.

314,689,689-1,Uganda,ADF,"The creation of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) resulted from the merger between the Tablighi Jamaat sect and the National Army for the Liberation of Uganda (NALU). After legislative elections in June 1996, the Allied Democratic Front (ADF) claimed that the presidential and legislative elections of that year had been rigged.  On November 13, 1996, ADF rebels infiltrated Uganda from Zaire and captured the towns of Mpondwe and Bwera. The ADF operated in the Rwenzori area  on both sides of the Uganda-DRC border. In August 1997, President Museveni publicly stated that he was willing to pardon fighters from the ADF who turned themselves in. In October 1997, the ADF sent a list of preconditions for peace talks to President Museveni. These included power-sharing with the rebel groups, suspension of the country’s 1995 constitution that bans all political parties, and the release of all captured rebels. The Ugandan Government did not respond to these demands. Starting in May 1998, Uganda claimed that ADF border attacks were increasing in frequency, intensity, and destructiveness and accused the DRC and Sudanese governments for supporting the group. The Congolese government declined accusations of support. Nevertheless, fighting the ADF served Uganda as pretext for its military presence in DRC and pursue other goals in the DRC. This is supported by the fact that Uganda went far beyond the border. Ugandan troops ventured all the way to Isoro, which is 580km from the border. On 1 September 1998, Ugandan troops were in Kisangani. No negotiations or mediation took place in 1998 between the Government of Uganda and the ADF took place, but Uganda and the DRC did engage in negotiations. Shortly after Laurent Kabila took of power, the DRC and Uganda signed a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ which foresaw joint operations between the national armies. A treaty of mutual security was signed on 26 April 1998. Yet, on 17 July 1998, Kabila who had benefitted from Ugandan support to accede to the presidency requested all foreign troops to leave the Congolese territory. This abruptly ended DRC-Uganda military cooperation.  In May 1999, Roman Catholic leaders of the Ruwenzori region offered to mediate between the Ugandan Government and the ADF, but this offer was not accepted. In November 1999, the Chairman of the Ugandan district of Kasese, Yokas Mikande, and the Busongora South Minister of Parliament, Christopher Kibanzanga, held seven peace meetings with the commanders of the ADF in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

The negotiations were aimed at reaching a ceasefire and amnesty, but the talks failed because the negotiations were complicated as a result of the fragmentation of the ADF's leadership.

The meeting in Washington, which was also attended by the Portuguese intermediaries and Soviet diplomats, led to what became known as the Washington Concepts Paper. The Washington Concept Paper stipulated that once a ceasefire would be concluded the conflict parties would organize free and fair elections; and that the parties would create a national army between the time of the conclusion of the ceasefire and the elections. The Washington Concept Paper further specified that the restructuring of the army and holding of elections were to be overseen by a UN monitoring force.",United States of America,1990,12,1990,12,Portugal; US; Russia (Soviet Union) ,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,,,,2558,1,0,0

This allowed the conflict parties to focus on the remaining key issues, which were the formulation of a unified national army, the setting of dates for a ceasefire and multiparty elections, and the international monitoring of implementation of an agreement. Of these remaining issues, the election date proved to be the most contentious point. While the MPLA government demanded the election to be held three years after the ceasefire date, UNITA proposed the elections to be held as early as nine months after the ceasefire. It was only after the US and the Russia (Soviet Union) agreed to take part in the implementation process of the agreement that the conflict parties agreed to the elections taking place 18 months after the ceasefire would take effect, which was set on 15 May 1991.

327,714,714-11,Angola,UNITA,"On 31 May 1991, the Bicesse Agreement was signed. A variety of different mediation methods were used by the third parties to move the conflict parties towards the Bicesse Accords. First, the Bush administration made negotiations more attractive to the MPLA Government by promising that if the conflict parties would reach a negotiated settlement, then Washington would normalise relations with the MPLA Government and recognise it.  Second, the third parties used military inducements, both through extending and refusing to extend military assistance. Seeking to maintain their position in Southern Africa, the US had been supporting UNITA, while the Russia (Soviet Union) had been supporting the MPLA government. However, as the Cold War waned by the end of the 1980s, the conflict parties could no longer depend on unqualified support from their clients. Besides scaling back their support, both Washington and Moscow became increasingly willing to apply pressure to the conflict parties in favour of a peaceful solution to the conflict. The US drew on its patron client relationship with UNITA by urging the latter to make public statements calling for national reconciliation, making it easier for the MPLA government to reach out. The US had also tacitly assured dos Santos that with national reconciliation, the military aid to UNITA would be ended. In addition, the third parties guaranteed the implementation of the Bicesse Accords. The agreement stipulated that representatives of Portugal, the USA and the USSR, together with sub-groups and members of the government and UNITA, were to take part in the joint Politico-Military Commission (CCPM), with the task of overseeing the political and ceasefire process. It was also agreed that around 30 observer states would be involved in the implementation process, as well as a UN force of 800 people financed by a US grant of 40 million US Dollars. Moreover, President dos Santos was promised by US Secretary of State James Baker that “the USA had all the means to guarantee the implementation of the accords and also to prevent the accords being violated.”",Portugal,1991,5,1991,5,Portugal; US; Russia (Soviet Union),0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,Bicesse Agreement,1991,5,31,491,1,0,0

On 6 February 1992, the UN Secretary-General appointed Miss Margaret Joan Anstee as his Special Representative to coordinate all United Nations activities in connection with the Angola Peace Accords. Although no large-scale fighting took place until after the elections in the last week of September 1992, the security situation deteriorated as the elections came closer. Representatives from Portugal, the US and Russia (Soviet Union) continued their efforts in the CCPM, set up under the Bicesse accord, with the task of overseeing the political and ceasefire process. It was stipulated in this peace agreement that the CCPM was mandated to ensure the “implementation and functioning of the mechanisms instituted to verify and exercise control over the ceasefire, provided for in the [Bicesse Accords] documents signed on this subject.” The UN Angola Verification Mission II (UNAVEM II) also continued its work and in addition to the monitoring of the military aspects of the agreement, it also oversaw the elections in late 1992.

When UNITA took up arms again after the elections, the UN Security Council imposed sanctions against UNITA’s war effort. UN Security Council Resolution 864 issued on 15 September 1993 stipulated that all countries were prohibited from selling arms, petroleum, and related products to UNITA. Later resolutions also imposed travel restrictions and trade measures. In addition to imposing sanctions, the UN sponsored negotiations.

Since this deadline was yet again not met, the UN Security Council imposed new sanctions on UNITA on 25 June 1998, which stipulated the freezing of UNITA’s foreign bank accounts and a ban on the purchase of Angolan diamonds without a certificate of origin, as well as prohibited all air and water transport in and out of the territories controlled by UNITA. Savimbi had indicated on 6 June 1998 that if the UN would impose new sanctions, UNITA would regard this as an attack on UNITA to which it was ready to respond. Indeed, following the imposition of new UN sanctions, UNITA immediately seized control in some of the localities in which it had transferred power to the central government. By the end of 1998, the Government of Angola had lost patience with the lack of implementation of the Lusaka Protocol and resumed the civil war.

No negotiations or mediation took place between the Government of Somalia and SNM between 1983 and 1988. In 1989, the US Ambassador Frank Crigler urged the conflict parties to engage in peace talks. The US was in a good position to influence the Government of Somalia, as it had been providing military assistance to the Government of Somalia since 1983. Moreover, US Secretary of State James Baker had threatened the Somali Prime Minster that US bilateral assistance would be suspended unless the Government of Somalia would improve its respect for human rights and listen to the opposition movements. US diplomats subsequently talked to the SNM in one of the rebel organisation’s offices in Washington, while another US delegation held talks with the USC in Nairobi. As it had been severely weakened by mid-1989, the Barre regime accepted the offer to engage in official mediated negotiations. Yet, the rebel groups insisted that it was too late for negotiations, expressing that Barre had committed to many crimes and therefore had to go. Another mediation attempt was conducted by Italy and Egypt in 1990, which proposed a peace conference to be held in Cairo in December 1990. Although Egypt had been invited by Italy to join its peacemaking efforts, it was decided Boutros Boutros-Ghali, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Egypt, would act as the chief mediator at this conference. Yet, while the Government accepted, the SNM and the USC again rejected negotiations. Fighting continued until the main Somalia rebel groups, including SNM, managed to overthrow the Barre regime on 26 January 1991. Instead of participating in the struggle over government power between the USC and a breakaway faction of the USC led by General Mohammed Farah Aideed, the SNM decided to solely take control of the Issaq clan territory in the northwest, where most of the SNM fighters were from. Since it just had proclaimed an independent Republic of Somaliland on 16 May 1991, the SNM did not participate in the Djibouti peace conferences in June and July 1991.The SNM did participate in the Addis Ababa conference in 1993. From 4 to 15 January 1993, the UN – in collaboration with Ethiopia, the Organization of African Unity, the Arab League, the OIC, and the US – convened a preparatory meeting for a conference of national reconciliation and unity in Addis Ababa between several Somali political movements. In addition to hosting the talks, Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi mediated the negotiations. In his opening speech, Boutros-Ghali emphasised that the UN peace enforcement mission deployed in December 1992 created a window of opportunity that would not remain open for long, stating that “The world could forget about Somalia in a few minutes.” On 8 January 1993, the conflict parties declared an immediate ceasefire and a cessation of all hostile propaganda against each other.

This resistance against Mahdi assuming the Presidency not only came from other rebel groups. A military faction within the USC, led by General Mohammed Farah Aideed, also rejected Mahdi’s self-appointment as illegitimate. This group is referred to as the United Somali Congress / Somali National Alliance (USC/SNA), also known as the United Somali Congress Faction (USC Faction). Although internal competition within the USC was already prevalent well before Siyaad Barre was overthrown, tensions between the USC led by Ali Mahdi and the USC/SNAled by Aideed started to grow even further from early 1991 onwards. The Arab League tried to reconcile the USC and the USC Faction, but failed in persuading the latter to attend two peace conferences in Djibouti in June and July 1991. The conflict further escalated in September 1991, when Aideed demanded Mahdi’s resignation. Although there had been sporadic clashes between the forces loyal to Mahdi and Aideed in Mogadishu in March and June, fighting between 5 and 7 September resulted in hundreds of people killed.

341,761,761-3,Liberia,LURD,"A new round of negotiations, within the framework of the ECOWAS Peace Process for Liberia, took place in Akosombo in June and July 2003.

The President of Ghana, John Agyekum Kufuor, who had assumed the role of Chairman of ECOWAS on 31 January 2003, as well as General Abdulsalami Abubakar, former Head of State of Nigeria, acted as the mediators at these talks, but Abubakar acted as the chief mediator. Throughout the negotiations, Chief mediator Abubakar employed a mediation strategy aimed at facilitating consensus among the conflict parties. However, the negotiations were simultaneously influenced by pressure from external actors. Arguably the most external influence came from an indictment against Charles Taylor. Just as the negotiations were to begin, on June 4 2003, the Special Court for Sierra Leone, which was established by the UN Security Council, issued an indictment against Charles Taylor for complicity in crimes against humanity in Sierra Leone. Consequently, Ghana had to decide whether to hand over Taylor or not. Many of the participants commented on the possible removal of Taylor as being in violation with African hospitality. Indeed, in line with earlier statements on the absolute safety of all participants in the negotiations, the Government of Ghana refused to turn over Taylor. Nonetheless, later the same day, Charles Taylor left Accra and went back to Monrovia, while negotiations would continue according to schedule. Although Charles Taylor stayed in close contact with the representatives of the Government of Liberia present in Accra, his departure had a profound effect on the dynamics of the negotiations. Before the indictment of Taylor, the prospect for the conclusion of a peace agreement seemed bleak. Most participants of the negotiations believed President Taylor would never give up his presidency, while the rebel parties would never compromise on their main demand of Taylor’s immediate removal. These insurmountable positions remained relevant when Taylor left Accra, as he still had no intention of giving up the presidency. However, the indictment resulted in Taylor losing any last support from international partners and de-legitimatized him. It also affected the morale of his troops, who had not been paid in months at that time. These developments negatively affected Taylor’s bargaining position in the negotiations. The conflict parties started negotiations on 12 June in order to conclude a ceasefire agreement in preparation for negotiations on a political solution to the conflict. This round of negotiations resulted in the conflict parties agreeing on a ceasefire on 17 June, in which a clause was included that Charles Taylor would not be included in the transitional government. Although the concluded ceasefire on 17 June did not hold, it had become clear that the indictment of Taylor enabled agreement on what had seemed fixed positions. After the conclusion of the ceasefire agreement on 17 June, negotiations mediated by General Abdulsalami Abubakar continued. During the negotiations in late June, he actively listened to the concerns of the adversaries without imposing any of his own solutions to end the conflict. As is noted by Hayner, some participants in the negotiations “were even frustrated with his mediation style at times: even while Monrovia was being shelled and the urgency seemed great, he remained in listening mode for several weeks, rather than pushing for agreement or action of any kind.” ",Ghana,2003,6,2003,6,ECOWAS; Ghana; Nigeria,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,Ceasefire,2003,6,17,1711,1,0,0

As early as 14 October, the Belgium Prime Minister Wilfried Martens, aided by his Foreign Minister and Defence Minister, travelled to Kigali to “halt the offensive and seek a peaceful solution within the framework of the Organization of African Unity.” Martens discussed the conflict with Rwandan President Habyarimana, Ugandan President Museveni, Zairian President Mobuto, and Tanzanian President Mwinyi. Belgium also tried to initiate negotiations between the conflict parties, yet as the Government of Rwanda claimed that the conflict was an interstate conflict with the FPR being Uganda’s proxy army rather than an independent insurgent group supported by Uganda, the Government of Rwanda refused to engage in mediated negotiate with the FPR. Moreover, the RPF demanded the direct resignation of President Habyarimana. The Belgian peace initiative was followed by several ad hoc summits organised by both the Communauté Économique des Pays des Grand Lacs (CEPGL) (English: the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries) and the Organization of African Unity: the Mwanza summit on 17 October attended by the Presidents of Tanzania, Rwanda, and Uganda; the Gbadolite summit on 26 October attended by the Presidents of Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi; and the Goma summit on 20 November attended by the Presidents of Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi, as well as the third deputy Prime Minister of Uganda. The Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko acted as the chief mediator of the countries in the region during these summits. Mobutu’s appointment was in large part based on the idea that he could prevail over Habyarimana, thus delivering the agreement of the conflict party that the mediator favoured. Although no real attempts to bring the FPR in seemed to be made, talks were held between Ugandan President Museveni and Habyarimana, where the former promised to put pressure on the FPR to commit to a ceasefire. Indeed, to respect ongoing peace efforts, Rwanda and FPR concluded a ceasefire agreement, without any direct negotiations between them, on 24 October 1990. In addition, most of the regional conferences focused on the refugee problem, which was at least in part due to the perception that the refugee problem forced the FPR into Rwanda.

374,804,804-2,Rwanda,FPR,"Meetings between countries in the region continued to be held in early 1991 through the efforts of both the CEPGL and the Organization of African Unity, in which the participants discussed the refugee situation, as well as the possibility of the deployment of a neutral peacekeeping force in Rwanda. Summits were held in Zanzibar on 17 February and Dar-es-Salaam on 19 February. While little effort was made to include the FPR in negotiations during the summits in 1990, the regional leaders persuaded President Habyarimana to engage in peace talks with the FPR leadership during the summits in early 1991. At the Dar-es-Salaam summit on 19 February, a Declaration was drafted in which President Mobutu was thanked “for his efforts in instituting a dialogue between the Rwandan government and the armed opposition” and urged him to “maintain the momentum of the dialogue.” The Declaration further committed the conflict parties to “find a definitive and durable solution to the problem.” Accordingly, the Government of Rwanda and the FPR met for the first time in March 1991. Under Mobutu’s mediation, the conflict parties agreed to the conclusion of a ceasefire on 17 March 1991, which was signed by Rwandan Foreign Minister Casimir Bizimugu and FPR vice-Chairman Paul Kagame in N’Sele on 29 March 1991. This agreement stipulated a ceasefire and the deployment of a Neutral Military Observer Group, comprised of personnel from Nigeria, Senegal, Zimbabwe, the Organization of African Unity, and representatives of the warring parties. The agreement – referred to as the N’Sele Ceasefire Agreement – did not include provisions on how to resolve the conflict issues. Instead, the document included a short agenda for future talks, specifying that rule of law and democracy should be created, that the formation of a new national army should commence, and that power-sharing arrangements need to be established.

The RUF was led by a former army corporal, Foday Sankoh, who had been trained in Libya during the 1980s. The RUF received military and financial support from the National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by Charles Taylor.  The RUF initially rapidly advanced, but the Sierra Leonean army went on the offensive in late 1991, after which the fighting reached a stalemate by the beginning of 1992. One-party rule had been abolished in Sierra Leone in 1991 and elections were to be held in July of 1992 to establish a democratic regime. Yet, these elections were never held, since disgruntled soldiers staged a coup in April 1992, forming the National Provisional Ruling Council (NPRC). The NPRC acted as a military junta and was led by Captain Valentine Strasser. The NPRC had made it clear that the war against the RUF would continue, which resulted in the RUF suffering massive defeats throughout 1993.  The government issued a unilateral ceasefire declared in December 1993.

The RUF used this unilateral ceasefire declared by the Government of Sierra Leone in December 1993 to regroup, after which they conducted a counterattack in early 1994. In November 1994, the Head of State of Sierra Leone addressed a letter to the UN Secretary-General, formally requesting him to provide his good offices to facilitate negotiations between the Government and the RUF. The RUF and the government reached a ceasefire agreement on 4 December in indirect negotiations, paving the way for official negtoiations.

The main reason for this is that the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council (AFRC) toppled the Government of Sierra Leone in a coup on 25 May 1997 and took control of the Government, after which the RUF entered into an alliance with the AFRC. The AFRC was ousted from power in February 1998, when ECOMOG took control over Freetown. President Kabbah was reinstated in March 1998. No mediation or negotiations took place between the RUF and the Government of Sierra Leone in 1997 and 1998, prior to the May 1997 coup and following the AFRC being ousted from power in March 1998.  Although the AFRC and the RUF were ousted from power in early 1998, the war was not over. The AFRC and RUF remained and put up tough resistance against the government forces and their allies in the eastern parts of Sierra Leone. On 1 January, the government announced it had reached a temporary ceasefire with RUF through indirect negotiations. Even so, the RUF and the AFRC forces invaded Freetown on 6 January 1999, resulting in a battle that lasted for more than six weeks. Following the attack on Freetown, heavy international pressure began to be put on the Kabbah government to negotiate a peaceful settlement with RUF. The US, the UN and the UK became more strongly involved. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan actively supported the efforts of his Special Representative Francis Okelo to initiate negotiations. What is more, the UN Security Council arms and oil embargo that had been adopted in 1997 was still in place.

After this successful coup, the AFRC formed a new government with the RUF and civilians. In July 1997, under the ECOMOG flag – together with the Ivory Coast, Guinea and Ghana – Nigeria began to lead the military campaign to restore Kabbah to power. This campaign initially failed. As a result, a four-nation committee – consisting of Nigeria, Ivory Coast, Guinea, and Ghana – established by ECOWAS subsequently negotiated with both Kabbah supporters and the AFRC in Conakry, Guinea, on 23 October 1997. The parties agreed that President Kabbah would be reinstated within six months, but the AFRC effectively stalled the implementation of this agreement. By January 1998, as many as 10,000 Nigerian troops were stationed in Sierra Leone, which together with the Kamajors fought the AFRC junta. In February 1998, fighting between the ECOMOG forces and the forces of the AFRC and the RUF escalated, which resulted in ECOMOG taking control over Freetown, reinstating President Kabbah in March 1998.

One of the reasons for the coup was resentment among the Yakoma soldiers was the perceived preferential treatment of Presidential Guard. The coup attempt was fairly limited in scope, with most of the fighting taking place within a short period of time and in a restricted geographical area. After the initial attack on the presidential residence, there was intense shelling of the capital’s south-western districts, where the rebels were hiding. A group of around 100 Libyan soldiers, as well as a group of rebel fighters of the Mouvement de Libération du Congo (MLC) (English: Movement for the Liberation of the Congo), supported the government forces in preventing the coup. On 31 May 2001, Kolingba announced that “Taking due account of the urgent and patriotic appeal from the people's representatives, I have agreed to order hostilities to cease as of this evening. I am asking the mutineers to return to their homes.” After two weeks of fighting in Bangui, the Government troops had seized control of the entire city. A manhunt against Yakuma families commenced, leading to some 80,000 civilians fleeing the capital. The UN condemned the coup, but stressed that there must not be a witch-hunt of the Yakoma tribe. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan manated former Malian President Amadou Touré as the UN peace envoy to the Central African Republic on 5 June 2001. Annan stated that in response to the violence that continues to plague the Central African Republic, following the attempted coup on 27 and 28 May 2001, he decided to “dispatch to Bangui, as his Special Envoy, General Amadou Toumani Touré of Mali, for urgent talks with President Patassé and other authorities and actors. The Special Envoy will hold discussions with his interlocutors with a view to ending the fighting that reportedly continues in parts of Bangui between forces loyal to the Government and the rebels, and restoring peaceful political dialogue within the framework of respect for the country’s democratic institutions.” UN peace envoy and former Malian President Amadou Touré subsequently mediated peace talks in Bangui in June 2001, involving the government, the opposition, and civil society.",Central African Republic,2001,6,2001,6,UN,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,,,,,195,1,0,0

Djotodia could not control the Seleka movement, with many local Seleka commanders ruling town and villages as their personal fiefdoms. Many of the Seleka engaged in the mass killing of Christians in Bangui and throughout CAR. This led to the emergence of a self-defense militia, called the anti-Balaka. From this point onwards, the armed violence in the Central African Republic was mainly between non-state armed groups. Unable to control the Seleka fighters, Djotodia disbanded the Seleka. However, this made it even harder to control the Seleka.

The CPJP also agreed to immediate cessation of all hostility, the abstention from all military action and other forms of violence and to join the DDR campaign that several other opposition groups had already joined. After the signing of the ceasefire, no fighting between the Government and CPJP took place in 2011. ",Central African Republic,2011,6,2011,6,,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,Ceasefire,2011,6,12,44,1,0,0

This excluded the northern presidential candidate Alassane Ouattara, who broadly represented the predominantly Muslim north, from participating in the elections. This led to rising tensions. A mutiny broke out on 19 September 2002, which was triggered by President Gbagbo sending around 750 soldiers – who were known for their loyalty to Robert Guéi, which was Gbagbo’s main rival in the 2000 elections – into forced retirement. Many soldiers had indeed left the army, but had refused to turn in their weapons. The mutineers further organized themselves into the Mouvement patriotique de la Cote d’Ivoire (MPCI) (English: Patriotic Movement of Ivory Coast) led by Guillaume Soro. The MPCI demanded President Gbagbo to step down from power and organise elections within six months, open to all Ivoirians. Third party efforts aimed at ending the fighting between the Government and the MPCI were initiated at early stage in the conflict. On 31 September 2002, a team of diplomats from several West African nations – including Ghana, Mali, Nigeria, Niger, Togo, and Guinea-Bissau – arrived in Abidjan to meet President Gbago and the armed opposition. This group of countries was known as the contact group which had been established at an ECOWAS meeting in Accra on 29 September 2002. The parties were close to concluding a ceasefire agreement in early October 2002, but President Gbagbo refused to sign a ceasefire at the last moment, as according to him this would legitimise the rebel movement and partition the country.

After two days of talks, on 1 November, a joint statement was issued. This statement was referred to as the Lomé Ceasefire Agreement, outlining a basic agenda of future discussions. The Lomé ceasefire agreement together with the Abidjan agreement provided the basis for military intervention by ECOWAS and France. In spite of these third party peacemaking efforts, negotiations stalled, as rebels continued to demand the resignation of president Gbago, which was unacceptable to the Government of the Ivory Coast. The Government, in turn, insisted on the immediate disarmament of the rebels, which MPCI refused. Furthermore, the negotiations became increasingly complicated, as two new rebel groups – the MPIGO and the MJP – appeared in the west of the country. This negatively affected the level of trust between the Government and MPCI, resulting in the breaching of the truce on several occasions. On 23 December 2002, the MPCI spokesman called for the UN and France to take over negotiations, as the rebels had lost confidence in the African mediators due to a lack of progress.",Togo,2002,10,2002,11,ECOWAS; Togo,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,Lomé Ceasefire Agreement,2002,11,1,543,1,0,0

On 9 June 2011, the SPLM/A-North expressed that it fought to remove the central Government in Khartoum. Abdel-Aziz Al-Hilu, a leading figure in the movement and the former deputy Governor of South Kordofan, stated the SPLM/A-North waged a “battle for dignity to accomplish the fundamental change in the centre.” The conflict in South Kordofan and Blue Nile can be seen as a continuation of the civil war between the Sudanese government and the SPLM/A between 1983 and 2005. While fighters from these two areas joined the SPLM/A rebellion as early as 1984. The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) concluded in 2005 stipulated a referendum on independence for southern Sudan, but this referendum did not apply to South Kordofan and Blue Nile. This provides the background to the SPLM/A-North rebellion. After fighting had started in June, the armed conflict quickly spread to other towns and villages in South Kordofan. In September, fighting also started in the state of Blue Nile, which is located east of South Kordofan, but the fighting in South Kordofan was more intense. The SPM/A-North was supported by the Government of South Sudan. In early June, the AU High-Level Implementation Panel on Sudan (AUHIP) led by former South African president Thabo Mbeki initiated mediated negotiations to end the fighting. SPLM/A-North chairman Malik Agar negotiated for the SPLM/A-North and Ali Nafi for the Sudanese government.This mediation effort led to the signing of a ceasefire on 16 June 2011.

309,11975,11975-10,Sudan,SPLM/A-North,"A government attack on the SPLM/A-North in Aroum on 23 January 2016 led SPLM/A-North officials to publicly question the government’s commitment to establishing peace. In late 2016, the AUHIP called upon the SPLM/A-North to review their positions on the talks on the Two Areas. The SPLM/A-N insisted on a provision allowing humanitarian access through Asosa in Ethiopia, but the Sudanese government rejected such a provision. In March 2017, the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement/Army-North (SPLM/A-N) split into two factions, resulting in several clashes. While there were many calls to engage in negotiations throughout 2017 and 2018, the conflict parties did not engage in peace talks. The split was a result of long-simmering ethnic and political–military tensions within the SPLM/A-N in Blue Nile. While the Uduk, Berta, and Burun had made up the majority of the SPLM/A’s 10th Division during war between the SPLM/A and the Sudanese government between 1983 and 2005, members of the Ingessana tribe assumed increasingly more power within the rebel group from 2012 onwards. This led to widespread dissatisfaction among the non-Ingessana tribes. Tensions were temporarily put on hold due to intense fighting between the SPLM/A-N and government forces throughout 2015-2016, but following a unilateral ceasefire issued by the Sudanese government on 18 June 2016 tensions escalated. In March 2017, SPLM/A-N deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu publicly released a resignation letter. Abdelaziz al-Hilu accused Agar of not fully representing the entire SPLM/A-N movement in the peace process led by the AU, particularly with regard to the issue of self-determination of the Nuba Mountains. Al-Hilu’s letter essentially forced the members of the SPLM/A-N to choose between himself and chairman Malik Agar of the Ingessana tribe. The Nuba Mountains Liberation Council (NMLC) subsequently passed resolutions that removed Arman as the SPLM/A-N’s lead negotiator with African Union High-Level Implementation Panel (AUHIP), as well as put the NMLC in power of both South Kordofan and Blue Nile. Moreover, many senior non-Ingessana leaders began to publicly voice support for al-Hilu and the NMLC. In April 2017, almost all of the non-Ingessana Blue Nile Liberation Council (BNLC) members declared their support for the NMLC decision to dismiss Arman as the SPLM/A-N AUHIP lead negotiator. Accordingly, although the deputy chairman Abdelaziz al-Hilu broke away from the rebel group led by chairman Malik Agar, the UCDP codes the SPLM/A-N led by Malik Agar (SPLM/A-N-MA) as the splinter faction because he was endorsed by the NMLC and most of the BNLC.  Preparations for official negotiations between the SPLM/A-North and the Sudanese government continued in spite of this split. SPLM/A-North representatives met with mediators from the AUHIP in Addis Ababa in late August 2017. In late September 2017, Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) special envoy for Sudan, Lesane Johannes, discussed details for the resumption of formal peace talks between the SPLM-North and the government with Sudanese Presidential adviser Ibrahim Mahmoud.

UN Security Council Resolution 1973 established a no-fly zone, which came into effect on 17 March 2011. At the 265th meeting of the AU Peace and Security Council, held in Addis Ababa on 10 March 2011, the AU established a High Level ad hoc Committee on Libya. The Committee consisted of the AU Commission Chairperson, Jean Ping, as well as five countries represented by their respective presidents: South Africa (Jacob Zuma), Mauritania (Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz), Mali (then under Amadou Toumani Toure), Congo Brazzavile (Denis Sassou Nguesso) and Uganda (Yoweri Museveni). The Committee was mandated to “(i) to engage with all the parties in Libya and continuously assess the evolution of the situation on the ground; (ii) to facilitate an all-inclusive dialogue between the Libyan parties on the appropriate reforms to be carried out; and (iii) to engage AU’s partners, in particular the League of Arab States (LAS), the Organisation of the Islamic Conference (OIC), the European Union (EU) and the United Nations, to facilitate coordination of efforts and seek their support for the early resolution of the crisis.”  On 17 March 2011, a week after the creation of the AU High Level ad hoc Committee on Libya, the United Nations Security Council gave the go-ahead for military intervention into Libya. The Libyan government announced a ceasefire the next day in response to the international intervention. The Libyan government would later recommit to a unilateral ceasefire on 20 and 25 March 2011, but government forces continued to conduct offensive operations. On 28 March 2011, the government also declared a cessation of hostilities in response to fighting in Misrata with NTC, but this ceasefire did not lead to any changes on the ground. Jacob Zuma headed an AU mission to Tripoli on 10 April 2011 to talk to President Gaddafi and present him with a peace plan. The next day, the AU mission consulted with the NTC leadership in Benghazi. Since the AU peace proposal did not include Gaddafi’s departure, the NTC rejected the peace plan and rejected to participate in direct peace talks to discuss the proposal.

One faction was loyal to President Salva Kiir, while the other faction was loyal to the former vice-president Riek Machar. Machar had been ousted from the government in July 2013. In mid-December, President Kiir accused Riek Machar of conducting a coup d’état, but this accusation later proved to be unsubstantiated. The accusation is widely seen as a pretext for crack down on Machar and pushing all Nuer troops out of Juba, after which Nuer civilians were targeted. Armed clashes between the conflict parties quickly spread to other areas, in particular to Bor, Malakal, and Bentiu. In response to the armed conflict, Salva Kiir also detained a group of eleven high-profile individuals, accusing them of conspiring with Riek Machar to overthrow the government. The political prisoners were all senior SPLM/A party members who had begun to openly criticize the president in 2013. This group has commonly been referred to as the “former detainees” after the first seven were released in January 2013 and the remaining four were released in in May 2014. As soon as the war broke out, Uganda intervened in the civil war in support of the South Sudanese government, while Sudan supported the SPLM/A-IO with weapons and ammunition. A delegation from the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD), which had mediated an end to the civil war in Sudan in 2005, visited Juba between 19 to 21 December 2013 for pre-negotiations with President Kiir and other relevant stakeholders to obtain a first-hand understanding of the crisis, to explore possible ways to resolve the crisis, and to make the conflict parties agree on official negotiations.

The chief over this groupement traditionally has influence over many other neighboring areas bordering Angola. After the death of the chief in 2011, the government of DRC refused to recognize the traditional appointment of Jean-Pierre Mpandi as Kamuina Nsapu due to his affiliation with groups opposed to the Kabila regime. Mpandi responded by calling the Congolese government an occupation government. On 3 April 2016, Mpandi’s home was searched, in his absence, for weapons. This incident reportedly exacerbated his animosity against the authorities. In April 2016, the Congolese government replaced Mpandi with his brother. Around this time, the first reports of an armed group called Kamuina Nsapu appeared in an effort to destabilize the government. On July 25 2016, a delegation was sent to Kamuina Nsapu to negotiate with Mpandi. This delegation was led by provincial minister of the interior, Simon Pierre Tshibuyi Kayembe. Tshibuyi’s report emphasized that Mpandi was upset that the provincial authorities had not acted on his request for official recognition of his customary title, and rejected the notion that he was forming a militia.
