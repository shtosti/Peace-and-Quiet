The CMA took up arms against the Government of Mali in January 2012 and it was initially joined by Ansar Dine. By March 2012, the two groups had seized control of most of northern Mali. Yet, the tactical alliance broke down and the two groups began to fight each other intermittently from 2 April 2012 onwards. Disagreement centered on Ansar Dine wanting to impose Islamic law throughout Mali, while the CMA wanted to create the independent secular state of Azawad solely in northern Mali. On 27 May 2012, the leaders of both sides tried to reconcile their differences through bilateral negotiations. This led to the conclusion of an agreement in late May 2012. Both groups agreed to merge and create the independent Islamic state of Azawad. CMA spokesman Moussa ag Assarid said the alliance marked a compromise. The conflict parties agreed to an Islamic state but one developed by their own imams and suited to local religious practices. However, the agreement broke down almost immediately and Ansar Dine turned again to their Islamist allies. In the summer of 2012, Ansar Dine allied with al-Qaida al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Maghrib al-Islami (AQIM) (English: al-Qaida Organisation in the Islamic Maghreb) against the CMA and captured the regional capitals of Kidal, Timbuktu, and Gao, destroying many Sufi shrines and enforcing sharia law.

Mbusa Nyamwisi appointed Jean-Pierre Mulondo Lonpondo governor and chief of staff in Ituri in early 2002. Although Lonpondo was a from the Nande ethnic group, many Hema perceived him, as biased against them as he had almost exclusively members of the Lendu ethnic group working in his administration. This further exacerbated local tensions. Around the same time, the RCD-K-ML’s minister of defense, Thomas Lubanga, proposed a plan to restructure the army, but both Molondo and Nyamwisi rejected this plan. Lubanga subsequently announced in April 2002 that he was no longer with RCD-K-ML, but with UPC (he was allegedly supported in that move by Uganda). As a consequence, Molondo sent RCD-K-ML troops to attack the residence of Lubanga. The Ugandan government sent troops to calm the situation and evacuated UPC fighters to the airport. Uganda also tried to mediate, inviting the UPC to Kampala and offer them to put them in touch with RCD-K-ML leader Mbusa Nyamwisi. The Ugandans subsequently brought the UPC delegation to Kasese in early August 2008 to negotiate with a RCD-K-ML delegation, though Nyamwisi was not present at these negotiations. The talks end without resolution. When arriving for supposedly another round of negotiations in Uganda mediated by Museveni, the UPC delegation was deported to a prison in Kinshasa. Yet, on 22 August 2002, the UPC – now led by General Floribert Kisembo (who would later lead the Parti pour l’unité et la sauvegarde de l’intégrité du Congo (PUSIC) (English: Party for Unity and Safeguarding of the Integrity of Congo) together with Yves Khawa Panga Mandro) – took control over Bunia from RCD-K-ML, chasing  Jean-Pierre Mulondo Lonpondo and his forces to Beni.

The immediate trigger of the conflict was the withdrawal of the Ugandan forces from Ituri as a result of international pressure. Anticipating this withdrawal, the UPC attacked a Ugandan military base in N’Délé on 6 March 2003. Uganda, in turn, attacked the UPC in Bunia in close cooperation with the FNI and the FRPI. This offensive was aimed at putting the FNI and the FRPI in control of Bunia before Uganda’s withdrawal. The coalition of FNI and FRPI came into Bunia from the North, while the Ugandan army came in from the South. The UPC resistance quickly collapsed and the UPC fighters left the city in March 2003.

In October 2000, Presidential elections were held in the Ivory Coast. Prior to these elections, a new constitution had been approved through a constitutional referendum. The new constitution stipulated that both parents of a presidential candidate had to be born within the country. As a result, the Supreme Court disqualified around 70 percent of the presidential candidates. Alassane Ouattara, representing the Rassemblement des Républicains de Côte d’Ivoire (RDR), was one of the disqualified presidential candidates. What is more, when early election results suggested that the presidency would be won by opposition leader Laurent Gbagbo and his political party the Front Populaire Ivoirien (FPI), President Robert Gueï tried to clench to power by dissolving the Electoral Commission and proclaiming himself the new president. Laurent Gbagbo subsequently called upon his supporters to protests Gueï’s attempt to clench to power. After severe clashes between protesters and Security Forces, Gueï was forced to leave the country and Laurent Gbagbo assumed the role of president. In the immediate aftermath, the RDR organized demonstrations and demanded new elections in which Alassane Ouattara could also participate. Laurent Gbagbo refused new elections. This led to clashes between the supporters of the two political rivals in the streets of Abidjan. In response to the clashes in Abidjan, a mediation committee comprised of government representatives, RDR officials, and members of the security forces was formed in late October in order to ease tensions ahead of the parliamentary elections which were scheduled to take place on 10 December 2000. French and American diplomats worked behind the scene to help the mediation committee broker a deal. By 9 December 2000, a day before the parliamentary elections, the mediation committee finally came to an agreement. This agreement entailed that the government led by Gbagbo would postpone the parliamentary elections by a week to allow the RDR to appeal the earlier Supreme Court ruling to exclude Alassane Ouattara from running. In return, the RDR agreed to postpone their planned boycott of the elections and call off all street protests. However, instead of announcing the agreement on national television as agreed, Interior Minister Emile Boga Doudou rejected the plan at the last minute and publicly declared that elections would go ahead as scheduled.",2000,12,2000,12,Ivory Coast,0,1,government; government forces; France; US,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,peace agreement,9,12,2000,31,1,0,0

Prior to these clashes, Mohamed Sahnoun had been appointed as the Special Representative on Somalia for the UN Secretary-General in March 1992. Sahoun was mandated to work out a “plan whereby the United Nations could facilitate the cessation of hostilities between the Somali factions, promote reconciliation, and provide urgently needed humanitarian assistance.” By mid-October 1992, all major conflict parties agreed to a reconciliation conference. The Ethiopian President Meles Zenawi would act as the chief mediator of this conference that was scheduled to take place in Addis Ababa in January 1993. The UN Secretary-General would attend the conference as well. On 5 December 1992, the American-led Unified Task Force (UNITAF) was deployed in Mogadishu to create a secure environment for conducting humanitarian operations. However, the force was also used to move the conflict parties to the negotiation table. For instance, as soon as USC/SNA leader General Mohammed Farah Aideed made it clear that he would not participate in the Addis Ababa conference, the US attacked one of his camps in Mogadishu with 400 marines. Aideed subsequently agreed to come to Addis Ababa.

The Tivs in the town of Lafia were soon accused of committing the murders and the ensuing violence was mainly concentrated in Nasarawa State and led more than 50,000 people to flee the area. On 18 June 2001, the Nigerian government mediated peace talks between the conflict parties.

In 1997, armed fighting broke out between the Nigerien Fulani herders and the Malian nomadic Tuaregs. The conflict was triggered by a dispute over the use of a well. The government of Mali responded to the violence by inviting the Nigerian government to talks in the city of Menaka in Mali. These talks were held in mid-March in Menaka after the first outburst of violence. The talks were unsuccessful since violence flared up once again in July 1997. However, armed fighting did not continue after the summer of 1997. After the start of the civil war in Mali in 2012, the Fulani became fearful that the Tuareg would dominate the inner delta of the Niger river. As a result, tensions between the two tribes increased.

Negotiations between the ARLA and the MPA, without the involvement of a mediator, led to the conclusion of a treaty on 11 April 1994.

The leadership of the ULIMO reflected these ethnicities. Alhaji Kromah, of Mandingo ethnicity, was the head of the organization, while Roosevelt Johnson, of Krahn ethnicity, was the field commander. This division of power kept internal rivalries largely in check, but this changed with the conclusion of the Cotonu Peace Agreement on 25 July 1993. This agreement aimed to end the national-level conflict and specified the transitional arrangements until the presidential elections.

In March 1994, already prior to the council being fully installed on 20 April 1994, tensions about who should take the seats within the council and about the leadership question of the ULIMO more broadly had led to clashes between the two rival factions within the rebel group.

It became clear during this meeting that Nigeria would accept Ghana’s position that only the inclusion of the warlords in the government would bring peace to Liberia. Consequently, Abacha had also held private consultations with NPFL leader Taylor for four days prior to the negotiations in Abuja, which had led to a rapprochement between Nigeria and the NPFL. With Nigeria no long opposing his ambitions, Taylor became more amenable to a political solution to the conflict. The Abuja Agreement gave sole authority for military enforcement to ECOMOG and removed the role that the Akosombo Agreement had assigned to the LNTG.  A ceasefire was re-declared, which would take effect on 26 August 1995. The agreement also established a time-frame for the formation of an interim government and the distribution of positions within the interim government.  All signatory rebel groups of the Abuja Agreement – including the ULIMO, the United Liberation Front of Liberia for Democracy faction led by Roosevelt Johnson (ULIMO-J), NPFL, the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL), the National Patriotic Front of Liberia - Central Revolutionary Council (NPFL-CRC), and LNC – sent orders to their commanders to cease hostilities.

Yet, the LPC was not included in this peace process either. Hence, the LPC rejected the Akosombo agreement. Consequently, the peace process continued and another conference started in Accra on 22 November and led to a ceasefire agreement and a reaffirmation of the Akosombo agreement on 22 December 1994.

The clashes took place in the context of a struggle over political power in the wake of the Abuja Accord concluded in December 1995. ULIMO-J fighters were among the first to violate the terms of this agreement, when they resisted the deployment of ECOMOG troops around the diamond mines near Tubmanburg. The leader of the ULIMO-J, Roosevelt Johnson, was dismissed from leadership in early 1996. Since he represented the ULIMO-J, Roosevelt Johnson was subsequently also removed from the transitional government. On 6 April, Charles Taylor tried to arrest Roosevelt Johnson, which led to heavy fighting between Taylor’s NPFL and ULIMO-J fighters loyal to Roosevelt Johnson. While the ULIMO-K fought alongside the NPFL, the ULIMO-J was supported by the AFL and the LPC.

More specifically, NPFL leader Charles Taylor was challenged by Prince Yormie Johnson in January 1990. Johnson subsequently left NPFL and set up the INPFL. He was followed by around 500 fighters. In response to the split, the two conflict parties clashed in late January 1990. The groups were geographically separated for some time following this initial clash. The INPFL was based in and around Monrovia, while Charles Taylor had set up a parallel government in the northern city of Gbarnga in Bong County. The conflict parties clashed occasionally during attempts of the NPFL to capture the capital. It should, however, be noted that the level of fighting between the NPFL and the INPFl was low in comparison to the violence between these two groups on the one side and the government forces on the other side.

Tensions rose due to Uganda falling out with Rwanda, as well as more general leadership struggles within the RCD, not least due to the upcoming negotiations in which many individuals wanted to have an important role. After a congress aimed at uniting the movement in Goma in January 1999, Emile Ilunga was appointed as the new leader of RCD-Goma. Wamba dia Wamba subsequently moved to Kisangani, where he was protected by Ugandan troops, declaring that he was not stepping down. The split was finalized in May 1999, resulting in the formation of the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie-Mouvement de Libération (RCD-ML) (English: Congolese Democratic Rally-Liberation Movement). After clashes between the Ugandan backed RCD-ML and Rwandan backed RCD-Goma in Kisangani in August 1999, Wamba again had to flee, this time to Ituri, where he set up the RCD-ML headquarters in Bunia. In 2000, the RCD-ML experienced a split, when the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie-Kisangani-Mouvement de Libération (RCD-K-ML) (English: Congolese Rally for Democracy-Kisangani-Liberation Movement) broke away. Ugandan generals started to support Wamba’s principal lieutenants. This further fueled an underlying conflict between Wamba dia Wamba, Nande Mbusa Nyamwisi, and the Hema John Tibasima. Both lieutenants started to train separate militias. The two factions fought each other in the context of this split, with violent battles taking place in Bunia in October and November 2000. Museveni subsequently chose the side of Wamba and evacuated Wamba to Uganda in November 2000. Factional fighting continued and spread to the Ugandan border-post Kasindi. After several unsuccessful attempts at mediation by Uganda during November and December, Wamba dia Wamba was exiled to Kampala in December. In order to restore calm to Ituri and avoid new splinter groups developing within the RCD-ML, Uganda forced all militias under their control: RCD-ML, the new RCD-K-ML, RCD-N and MLC to join forces within a new movement: the Front de libération du Congo (FLC).

In fact, A large number of the Terjam fighters belong to the Popular Defense Forces (PDF), while many of the Rizeigat Abbala fighters belonged to the Border Intelligence Guards. The background to the conflict between the two tribes is that with many of the Fur fleeing their home land, the Terjam and the Reizegat Abbala competed over control over parts of this land. Moreover, the Reizegat Abbala encroached on small areas controlled by the Terjam, increasingly leading to tensions between the two groups. These tensions eventually escalated into armed confrontations, starting in the Bulbul area of South Darfur in January 2007. Since the Reizegat Abbala had been heavily armed by the Sudanese government forces in order to fight the Darfurian rebel groups, it was able to inflict many losses on the Terjam fighters. On 7 January 2007, the Deputy Governor, traveled to the Bulbul area to attempt to mediate between the conflict parties, but his convoy was ambushed and he was forced to return. The government managed to organize a reconciliation conference in Um Zaifa in late February 2007. The representatives of the Terjam and the Reizegat attending this conference agreed on turning over the perpetrators of theft and murder and pay compensation in the form of blood money for losses. However, on 25 February 2007, before the reconciliation conference concluded, Reizegat fighters attacked Amar Jadeed. This attack undermined the prospects for a successful reconciliation conference.

Uganda supported the formation of the FLC because it wanted to reunite the actors it supported and that had previously split. Uganda in particular wished to reunite Wamba dia Wamba on the one side with Mbusa Nyamwisi and John Tibasima on the other side. The alliance Uganda-Rwanda split and also because there were leadership struggles within the RCD (not least due to the upcoming negotiations in which many individuals wanted to have an important role).  Hat was formed as a result of Uganda’s mediation effort was called the Front de Libération du Congo (FLC) (English: Front for the Liberation of Congo). MLC leader Jean-Pierre Bemba was chosen as the front figure and Mbusa Nyamwisi as number two (after Wamba dia Wamba renounced). They formed a government in Gbadolite with 32 members. However, the alliance was short-lived due to leadership struggles between Jean-Pierre Bemba and Mbusa Nyamwisi. After Nyamwisi entered an alliance with Kabila in June 2001, the RCD-ML (Nyamwisi’s forces) and the MLC (Bemba’s forces) clashed in Beni – and the alliance subsequnety broke down. Mbusa Nyamwisi moved back to Beni in August and Bemba moved to Gbadolite. The original RCD leader Wamba-dia-Wamba continued to claim legitimacy as leader of the original RCD-ML. In response to the fighting between the conflict parties, the Ugandan government requested Bemba and Nyamwisi to come to Kampala to find a compromise.

During the civil war, the Murle Pibor Defence Forces, led by Ismail Konyi, fought against the SPLM/A during the civil war, with financial and military support by Khartoum. Simon Gatwich, the former South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF) leader, armed the Lou, also with support from Khartoum. President Salva Kiir initiated negotiations with SSDF leader Paulino Matip. This led to the Juba Declaration on Unity and Integration on 8 January 2006. The Declaration primarily laid the basis for unifying rival military forces in South Sudan, but also initiated a disarmament process. In the context of a disarmament process which also targeted the Murle and the Nuer, the SPLM/A mediated between the two tribes in June 2006. This mediation effort reportedly led to a decrease in tensions between the Murle and the Nuer.",2006,6,2006,6,Sudan,0,1,armed group,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,,,,,150,1,0,0

The Sudanese government, with support from the United Nations Mission in Sudan (UNMIS), facilitated a reconciliation meeting between the Nuer and the Murle in early May 2009, which led to the conclusion of a ceasefire. A Joint Lou Nuer/Murle ceasefire committee was subsequently mandated to help implement this ceasefire.  This reportedly reduced tensions in Akobo and Pibor counties of Jonglei State. On 13 May, the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) announced it would temporarily deploy around 120 civilian, military and police personnel to Akobo and Pibor to assist local communities to engage in dialogue to prevent further violence. In June 2009, the Southern Sudan Peace Commission worked with state authorities, traditional authorities, UNMIS, UN Development Programme, and PACT to organize a peace conference to resolve the conflict between the Murle and the Nuer, but this conference was postponed several times, until the governor delayed it indefinitely in December 2009.",2009,5,2009,5,Sudan,0,1,government; UNMIS,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,ceasefire,,5,2009,1195,1,0,0

However, the Lou Nuer conducted a coordinated, retaliatory attack on Murle cattle camps in the eastern part of Pibor county in late April 2011 and launched a large-scale attack killing hundreds of Murle in June 2011. Armed violence between the Nuer and the Murle continued following South Sudan gaining independence on 9 July 2011. On 18 August 2011, Murle youths conducted a massive attack on Nuer civilians in Pieri in Uror county, which resulted in around 740 people killed and the theft of 38,00 heads of cattle.

However, the Sudan Council of Churches (SCC) managed to initiate peace talks between the Murle and the Lou Nuer at a peace conference on 7 and 8 October 2011. Archbishop of the Episcopal Church of Sudan Daniel Deng Bul acted as the chief mediator. The conference brought together representatives of the Nuer and the Murle, as well as around 100 politicians from both the South Sudan national assembly and Jonglei state legislature. However, the peace conference did not produce a tangible outcome. Instead, the mediation team and the conflict parties agreed upon a four-step process, including (1) the delegations of the conflict parties consulting with their communities how to end the violence and address their grievances; (2) joint delegations with chiefs, women, and youth from both sides visiting communities to show that the peace process is a collective responsibility; (3) consultations with the communities on how to peace process could be taken forward; and (4) a peace conference aimed at an agreement on ending the violence and the return of abducted women and children prior to the start of the dry season in mid-December 2011.

This led to the signing of a ceasefire between the Government of Burundi and these two rebel groups on 7 October 2002. The Nkurunziza faction of the CNDD-FDD subsequently signed a ceasefire with the Government of Burundi on 2 December 2002, preparing the fighters of this faction for inclusion in the transitional government and in the army. The Palipehutu-FNL, on the other hand, continued to fight the Government of Burundi. Refusing to join the government, the Palipehutu-FNL remained as the only powerful rebel group that had not joined the peace process. By signing the agreement, the CNDD-FDD became part of the government. This placed the CNDD-FDD and the Palipehutu-FNL at loggerheads, which led to several clashes between the two rebel groups.

At this meeting, the leaders signed a memorandum of understanding with regards to the 7 October 2002 agreement. This memorandum established a joint ceasefire commission comprising six members each from the two rebel groups and the government, under the direction of a UN official.
